 *   frequency is `round(f * 10) / 10` — one decimal — and its string form drops
 *   the decimal entirely when the value is whole ("100", "69.9"). SW runs
 *   30–512 MHz and LR 30–87 MHz.
 * - ACRE keeps MHz with finer steps: the PRC-152 walks `(950 + 2i) * 0.0625`
 *   from 59.375, the PRC-343 and BF-888S step by 0.01. Three decimals covers
 *   the smallest of those exactly.
 *
 * Rounding also absorbs the float32 the join disagrees over. A transmission's
 * frequency is stringified in SQF and stored as a float32, so 69.9 comes back as
 * 69.90000152587891, while the snapshot carries the raw float 69.9. At these
